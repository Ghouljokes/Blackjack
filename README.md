# Blackjack

To run, simply run blackjacked.py
This program offers two modes: User controlled and automatic.

User controlled allows you to play against the dealer, while in automatic the game will be between the dealer and a CPU player. The CPU player will most likely lose.

PLANNED FEATURES:

- adding timing and delays
- improving CPU player's ai
- multiple players at one "table" (basically, you, the dealer, and a cpu player all playing the same game)
